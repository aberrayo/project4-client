# Movies Library

This app is a simple tool that allowes people to document movies they have
watched and share it with others. Users can create, update, and remove movies
they have saved and also can see what movies others have watched. But deleting
and updating personal files are only available for the user that created the
resourse.

## Technologies Used

1. REACT
1. JavaScript
1. HTML
1. Bootstrap

## Short Comings

I would like to have been more imaginative prior to starting the project and
come up wit a unique and challenging concept. The learning curve is that my
sense of what i can do is lagging behind what the tools the knowledge i have.
A good lesson.
Also in the front end, more work can be done. From styling the app better to
adding some javascript functionality to the stored data and giving the user more
feedback.

## Lessons Learned

I have learned several lessons during this project. From understanding how data
is structured and saved at the back end and how it communicates to the front end
and how the whole fullstock application architecture works.
Personally. I have gotten better at ways to approch problems and the efficient
way to go about solving those problems. That includes asking the right
questions and searching online resourses and understanding what i see.
